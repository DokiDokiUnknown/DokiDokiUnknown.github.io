            <h2>The Project</h2>

            <p> We were working on a project <i><b>" Project Libitina "</b></i>, we were experimenting on a girl many things more horrible each other, the girl screamed and cried but we ignored her the only thing we wanted was the success of the experiment. We stopped the experiment only when we see she will die.All the information <a href="Top_Secret.html">here</a>. When we didn't need her, she was in a room with no light of the surface for have the least chance she escapes. She was lonely and sad because she never met anyone expect us.</p>
                
            <h2>The Worst Day</h2>

            <p class="width">We were close to the purpose, but when I was to the room of the girl there was a text write with her blood : " <!--
            it's easier to abandon that to resist,
            it's easier to cry that to laugh,
            it's easier to see the life in black than in pink,
            it's easier to stay in the past than moving into the future,
            it's easier to do nothing to than to do everything you can to succeed,
            it's more difficult to smile in the life than to be sad ,
            so why I need to continue.-->".</p>

            <p>Then before we started the experience, she was like crazy and managed to escape from our hold. That was starting to become dangerous. Then the light were starting went on and off.  I saved the most recent documents . So if someone finds out this documents be really carefull.   </p>

            <h2 class="anecdote">HELP!</h2>
